# MUSUBI (a2a-contract-v0)

A contract layer for agents that act on each other's behalf. Prove and price, do not enforce at runtime. HORIZON SHIELD anchors the record. It does not judge it. The settlement verdict is a function you recompute, not a decree you trust.

## Walk it yourself (no account, no key of ours, no network)

    git clone https://github.com/ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield
    cd horizon-shield/workers/hs-ledger/nenrin/musubi-v0
    python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install cryptography
    python3 contract_v0.py --selftest        # expect: SELF-TEST PASSED, 6 of 6

`cryptography` is the only thing you install. If you prefer not to use a venv and pip refuses with "externally managed environment", `pip install --break-system-packages cryptography` does the same.

The verifier is offline by design. There is no endpoint to trust. You run the same code the operator runs and you reach the same verdict, or you have found a bug. This is a library and a CLI, not a hosted service; nothing needs to be deployed for you to check it.

## The CLI

    python3 contract_v0.py --selftest                     # 6 of 6 self checks
    python3 contract_v0.py --verify contract.json         # verify a signed contract
    python3 contract_v0.py --sign  contract_unsigned.json --key mykey.json --domain my.domain --out contract_A.json
    python3 contract_v0.py --settle contract.json --exec execution.json   # recompute the settlement verdict

## What each self check proves
1. build + two party sign + verify: a well formed contract with two valid signatures is accepted.
2. tamper after signing: one byte changed after signing is refused.
3. overclaim in establishes: a contract that claims performance or payment or legal effect in its own terms is refused.
4. settle, compliant execution: work inside the grant settles as within_grant.
5. settle, prohibited action: an action outside the grant settles as a deviation, named.
6. delegation subset: a sub grant that widens authority beyond its parent is rejected.

## Break it
Find a contract that verifies but should not, or a settlement that recomputes to the wrong verdict. Send the input that does it. A finding is worth more than a pass.

## Finding 7, and settle v1 (2026-09-24)
A red-team question on Bluesky (@quaxworld.art) asked what defines the authoritative event set when action and revocation receipts reach replicas in opposite orders, and whether that choice can be recomputed too. Taking it seriously exposed a real defect in `contract_v0.settle()`: it used the list order of execution records as time order. The same two records, swapped, flip the verdict when an approval and the conditional action it covers sit in different records. List order is arrival order. That is the bug the question described.

`settle_v1.py` replaces the rule. `contract_v0.py` is untouched (published, referenced).

    python3 settle_v1.py --selftest        # expect: SELF-TEST PASSED, 11 checks
    python3 settle_v1.py --settle contract.json --event e1.json --event rev.json --event e2.json   # any order

- The authoritative event set is every record bound to the contract, ordered by (anchor height, sha256 of the record bytes). Height recomputes from the chain, the sha from the bytes, arrival order plays no part. Check 1 shuffles the same records 50 times and asserts identical settlement bytes.
- When a revocation takes effect is a term of the signed grant, `grant.revocation.effective_at`: `anchor` or `delivery_ack`. A wall-clock rule is refused as not recomputable (check 8).
- Two records at the same height are a real ambiguity. They are broken by bytes only if the grant opts in with `grant.ordering.same_height: "record_sha256"`. Otherwise a tie that would change the outcome makes the verdict `underspecified`, and no guess leaks into the deviations list (checks 4, 5, 11).
- The same receipt delivered twice is one record (check 10). A revocation is terminal; re-granting is a new contract.
- What it does not establish is written into every settlement: that a claimed anchor height is true (recompute it against the chain), that the records are authentic (verify them first), that HS judged anything.

Check 7 reproduces the v0 defect and shows v1 settling identically in both orders. Break v1 next.

## Design
`ops/MUSUBI_a2a_contract_v0_DESIGN.md` in this repo.

The crypto primitives (canonical form, Ed25519 discipline, small order key rejection, the overclaim list) are shared verbatim with the agreement layer in `../agreement-v0/agreement_verify.py`. One source of truth. MUSUBI reuses them, it does not fork them, so the folder above must sit next to this one. That is why you clone the repo rather than download this file alone.

## Finding 8, and settle v1.1 (2026-09-24)
The same red team came back: let two replicas accept different anchor histories before finality, then reorg one after settlement. If authority is (height, sha), can both emit valid but incompatible receipts, and what proves convergence? For v1 the answer was yes. Working it through exposed two more holes of the same family, closed before anyone had to ask: v1 trusted whatever chain view it was handed, and it trusted the height a record claimed, so an approval could be backdated below the action it covers.

`settle_v1_1.py` adds this on top of v1 (v1 and v0 untouched).

    python3 settle_v1_1.py --selftest       # expect: SELF-TEST PASSED, 11 checks
    python3 settle_v1_1.py --settle contract.json --event e1.json --event e2.json --view a.json --view b.json
    python3 settle_v1_1.py --settle contract.json --check settlement.json --view later.json

- The chain view is raw 80 byte Bitcoin headers, verified, not trusted: prev hash linkage, double SHA256 proof of work against each header's nBits, a difficulty floor named in the signed grant (`grant.finality.max_target_bits`), and the contract's own checkpoint (`lower_bound`) must be in the view. Check 1 verifies the real mainnet genesis header; check 6 rejects four kinds of fabricated view.
- Fork choice is cumulative work computed from those headers. Equal work picks nothing (check 10).
- Every anchor carries a proof (append, prepend, sha256 operations, the OpenTimestamps model) from the record's commitment to the merkle root in the header at the claimed height. A record re-labelled to an older block without a proof into it is refused (check 7).
- The grant names `grant.finality.depth`. Above the horizon a settlement is `provisional`, bond `pending_finality`. Two forks can disagree, and both say provisional (check 2). After the reorg the recompute is final and the losing receipt is `superseded`, kept and never deleted (check 3). Replicas on the same verified view recompute identical bytes in any order (check 4). A heavier reorg deeper than the depth is exposed, not denied (check 5).
- A revocation counts only from the principal (check 9).
- Stated limits, also written into every settlement: linkage, work, floor and checkpoint are verified, not the full consensus rules; heaviest means heaviest among the views compared; record signatures are verified by the record verifiers, this function orders and compares.
